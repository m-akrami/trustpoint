### What is trustpoint?

trustpoint is an open-source device identity manager for modern zero trust networks. It uses mutual TLS (mTLS) as its backbone to assign each device a unique, cryptographically verifiable identity, which can be dynamically revoked if its posture changes or it becomes compromised.

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Access model           | ❌ Reactive security - allows access until trust is violated, then blocks the attacker                                                            | ✅ Proactive - denies all requests by default until the device verifies its identity                                       |
| Authentication layer   | 👤 User based only - requires the user to verify their identity before granting access                                                           | 📱 User and device bound - session identity is tied to both the device’s certificate and the user account                 |
| Trust basis            | ❓ Implicit - relies on IP reputation, passwords, and sometimes MFA                                                                               | 🔥 Explicit - cryptographic identity bound to both device and user account                                                |
| Blocking               | ⏱️ Delayed and imprecise - sessions wait for timeouts, or IPs must propagate on blocklists, multiple users sharing an IP (CGNAT) may be affected | ⚡️ Instant and precise - SIEM can immediately revoke the offending device and user identity via OCSP based on trust score |
| Visibility             | ❗️ Limited - if the device isn’t signed in, logs are tied only to IP addresses                                                                   | 👀 Increased - logs are bound to the device identity, including owner account, model, and properties                      |
| Resistance to spoofing | ⛓️‍💥 Weak - relies on IPs, which can be rotated or masked via VPN                                                                               | ⛓️ Strong - cryptographic identity cannot be spoofed or phished, and is harder to clone                                   |
| SIEM integration       | 🚫 Limited - only basic alert correlation                                                                                                        | 🌐 Native - provides device properties to the SIEM and enables automated revocation                                       |
| Zero-trust alignment   | 🩹 Partial - grants initial trust to clients before checks, all devices receive a baseline level of trust                                        | 🧱 Full - no trust is given until the device and current posture is verified, unknown devices are denied by default       |
